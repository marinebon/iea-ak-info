The condition of adult **pollock** was the second lowest on record and continued a decreasing trend since 2010. An index of overall biomass of demersal (living closer to the seafloor) and benthic (living on the bottom of the seafloor) fish and invertebrates (largely driven by biomass of pollock) dropped sharply between 2017 and 2018. Estimates of age-1 predation mortality remain above average for pollock while Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder mortality were at and below the mean, respectively.
