Bottom trawl, surface trawl, and acoustic surveys again docu- mented the presence of pollock and Pacific cod in the north- ern Bering Sea. Pollock biomass (total weight of all fish in the population) declined slightly from 2017 to 2018. However, more than 50% of **Pacific cod** biomass in the eastern Bering Sea was found over the northern portion of the shelf.

Community members provided invaluable observations of ecosystem response to the lack of sea ice over last winter. For example, large **Pacific cod** were caught in crab pots in Nome, indicating that these adult fish may have remained over the northern shelf last winter. 

There has been a negative trend in **Pacific cod** condition (i.e., skinnier fish at a given length) since a peak in 2003.
