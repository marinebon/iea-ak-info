The timing of the spring bloom was a bit late, but otherwise the conditions were typical of a low-ice year with above-average water temperatures and lack of cold pool (similar conditions to early 2000s). By late spring, small copepod abundances were at one of the highest levels recorded while krill abundances were low. A summer acoustic survey indicated low densities of **krill**, continuing a trend of low abundance of this important prey resource since 2012. Reduced energy transfer from the prey base to the top-level predators likely contributed to poor body condition and observed mortality events (i.e., mammals and seabirds).
