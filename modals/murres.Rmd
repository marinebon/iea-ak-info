A seabird die-off event, unprecedented in terms of spatial and temporal scale, occurred. Large numbers of seabirds (mainly **murres**) washed ashore from Bering Strait southward through Norton Sound and along the shores of St. Lawrence Island over several months. Starvation is the only identified cause of death to date. Based on historical diet information, it appears that large, lipid-rich zooplankton were in low supply in 2018. Community members, subsistence eggers, and scientists also observed reproductive failures and poor reproductive success (mainly by murres and kittiwakes).
