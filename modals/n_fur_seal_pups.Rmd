**Northern fur seal pup** production at St. Paul Island has been declining by ~4% per year since 1998 while while St. George Island pup production increased by about 5% since 2016. Also at the Pribilof Islands, seabird reproduction was poor, as expected for a warm year with little sea ice. On St. George Island, murres experienced the latest mean hatch date ever recorded.
