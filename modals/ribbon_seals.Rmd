Ice seal distributions were dramatically impacted by the lack of sea ice and retraction of the ice edge to the northeast. **Ribbon seals** were unusually scarce. Spotted seal pups weighed less and had less blubber than in recent years. NOAA received reports from communities in the region of exceptionally high numbers (~50) of dead seals (primarily young bearded seals) on beaches along the north side of St. Lawrence Island in early June. Additionally, 48 beached ice seals (bearded, ringed, and sub-adult spotted seals) were reported near Wales. The seals appeared to have poor body condition and empty stomachs.
