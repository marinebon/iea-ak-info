Wind and ocean patterns were favorable for winter-spawning flatfish (e.g., **arrowtooth flounder**, Northern rock sole) in 2018 indicating that larval fish were carried to nursery areas with optimal conditions for their survival; only 2015 and 2018 had larval drift trajectories consistent with above-average survival.
