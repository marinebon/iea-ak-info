		<h1>Chinook Salmon</h1>
		<p>
		Chinook salmon are less abundant in Sitka Sound in the winter than usual. This was related to the lack of availability of winter herring in the Sound, which serve as a key source of food for Chinook. If herring migration patterns have changed and they are more offshore now in the winter time, then lower winter Chinook abundance in Sitka Sound may be indicative of Chinook following herring offshore. The lack of winter Chinook in the Sound poses a substantial challenge to trollers in Sitka, who rely on this high value fishery as part of their overall fishing portfolio. The generally smaller boats that participate in this fishery cannot follow Chinook into the offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska in the winter where weather conditions can be extremely harsh. Low Chinook returns have been observed throughout Alaska since 2007.
