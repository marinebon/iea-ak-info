		<h1>Hatchery Salmon</h1>
		<p>
		Salmon fishermen in Southeast Alaska rely on a mix of wild and hatchery salmon returns for commercial fisheries. Fishermen in Sitka noted shifts in the success of local hatcheries over the last several years. While the Hidden Falls hatchery runs have declined, they noted increased availability of chum salmon from the Crawfish Inlet hatchery, which set records for the region in 2018. <a href = "https://www.ktoo.org/2018/09/02/hatchery-chum-catch-sets-new-southeast-record/" target = "_blank">Source.</a>
