**Larval pollock** production was high and their distribution shifted eastward and onto the shelf (typical of other warm years). However, poor condition and survival is predicted for these fish due to the diminished prey base available. The bottom trawl survey indicated that Pacific cod and pollock abundances were below average. Pacific cod abundance was lower, but bio- mass was higher (fewer, larger fish). There was no evidence of pollock recruitment, with low age-1 numbers since 2014 and abundance dominated by the 2012 year class.
