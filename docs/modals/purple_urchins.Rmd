The story was mixed for motile epifuana including crabs, urchins, and sand dollars. The biomass of some species groups (e.g., **urchins**, sand dollars) continued an increasing trend in 2018 while many commercial crab stocks declined. Pribilof Island blue king crab abundance remains below average, but most stocks (St. Matthew Island blue king crab, Tanner crab, and Bristol Bay red king crab) show declining trends. On the bright side, female snow crab abundance is above average and expected to continue to increase in coming years.
