		<p>
		A series of marine heatwaves that began in late 2013 triggered a steep and abrupt decline in Pacific cod in the Gulf that led to a closure of the directed federal fishery in 2020, leaving the fishermen that are highly dependent on this fishery in the region without their primary source of income (Barbeaux et al. 2020; Peterson-Williams et al. 2021). <a href = "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/2020-assessment-pacific-cod-stock-gulf-alaska" target = "_blank">Source.</a>
