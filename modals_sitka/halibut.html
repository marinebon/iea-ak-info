		Sitkan fishermen noted continued declines in the size of halibut harvested in the commercial fishery. The International Pacific Halibut Commission, which conducts stock assessments of Pacific halibut notes that halibut caught in its survey has declined from 55 kg in 1988 to 20 kg in 2014; however, researchers have not found conclusive relationships with environmental covariates for this decline noting "it may that other factors (e.g., bioenergetics or size-selective fishing) are more important contributors to variability in size-at-age." (Sullivan et al. 2018).
